# data-generation

The repository provides a synthetic multivariate time series data generator. 
The implementation is an extention of the cylinder-bell-funnel [1] time series data generator. 
The scipt enables synthetic data generation of different length, dimensions and samples. 

Scaleability_length.ipynb --> Generate time series of different length and fixed number of samples/dimensions. 
Scaleability_number.ipynb --> Generate time series of different number of samples and fixed number of dimensions/length. 
Scaleability_robustness.ipynb --> Generate time series of different number of relevant and noisy dimensions and fixed number of samples/length.
